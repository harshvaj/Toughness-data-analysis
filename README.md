# Toughness-data-analysis
In this notebook my attempt to classify a dataset available on Citrine Database and also MAP , I have classified the same 
data which has been used in  H.K.D.H. Bhadeshia, D.J.C. MacKay and L.-E. Svensson, Materials Science and Technology, 11 (1995) 1046-1051.
I have used Kernlized Support Vector Regressor and Neural Network for accomplishing this regression and  compared the techniques used as showm below. The link to the dataset on MAP website is http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/map/data/materials/weldmat-b.html#links
